# x402 Demo Site

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that demonstrates the x402 payment protocol in action and showcases ecosystem builders. The demo site includes a modern UI and a facilitator backend that handles payment verification and settlement.

## Overview

x402 is an open protocol for internet-native payments built around the HTTP 402 status code. This demo site showcases how to implement x402 in a real-world application, demonstrating:

- Payment-gated content access
- Real-time payment verification
- Payment settlement
- Integration with EVM-compatible blockchains

## Features

- **Payment Middleware**: Protect routes with a simple middleware configuration
- **Facilitator Backend**: Handle payment verification and settlement
- **Live Demo**: Try out the payment flow with a protected route

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A wallet with testnet USDC (for testing)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

2. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FACILITATOR_URL=your_facilitator_url
  RESOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
  NETWORK=sepolia
  PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
  ```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js application code
  - `/facilitator` - Payment facilitator API routes
  - `/protected` - Example protected route
- `/middleware.ts` - x402 payment middleware configuration
- `/ecosystem` - Directory of ecosystem builders 

## How It Works

1. When a user tries to access a protected route, the middleware checks for a valid payment
2. If no payment is found, the server responds with HTTP 402
3. The client can then make a payment and retry the request
4. The facilitator backend verifies the payment and allows access

## Adding Your Project to the Ecosystem

We welcome projects that are building with x402! To add your project to our ecosystem page, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new directory in `app/ecosystem/partners-data/[your-project-slug]`
3. Add your logo to `public/logos/`
4. Add your project's metadata in `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Project Name",
  "description": "A brief description of your project and how it uses x402",
  "logoUrl": "/logos/your-logo.png",
  "websiteUrl": "https://your-project.com", // ideally pointing to somehwere to learn more about the x402 integration
  "category": "Client-Side Integrations" // Must match one of our categories: - `Client-Side Integrations`, `Services/Endpoints`, `Infrastructure & Tooling`, `Learning & Community Resources`
}
```

**For Facilitators, use this JSON template:**

```json
{
  "name": "Your Facilitator Name",
  "description": "A brief description of your facilitator service and supported networks",
  "logoUrl": "/logos/your-logo.png",
  "websiteUrl": "https://your-facilitator.com",
  "category": "Facilitators",
  "facilitator": {
    "baseUrl": "https://your-facilitator.com",
    "networks": ["base", "bsc-mainnet", "polygon", "solana"],
    "schemes": ["exact"],
    "assets": ["ERC20"],
    "supports": {
      "verify": true,
      "settle": true,
      "supported": true,
      "list": false
    }
  }
}
```
