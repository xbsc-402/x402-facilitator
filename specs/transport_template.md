# Transport: `<name>`

## Summary

Describe the purpose and characteristics of this transport layer. Include example use cases and key advantages.

## Payment Required Signaling

Define how the server indicates that payment is required for resource access:

- **Mechanism**: How payment requirements are communicated (e.g., status codes, error messages)
- **Data Format**: Where and how the `PaymentRequirementsResponse` schema is included
- **Examples**: Complete examples of payment required responses using the `PaymentRequirementsResponse` schema

## Payment Payload Transmission

Define how clients send payment data to servers:

- **Mechanism**: How payment data is transmitted (e.g., headers, request body, metadata)
- **Data Format**: Encoding and structure requirements for the `PaymentPayload` schema
- **Examples**: Complete examples of requests with `PaymentPayload` data

## Settlement Response Delivery

Define how servers communicate payment settlement results:

- **Mechanism**: How settlement data is returned to clients
- **Data Format**: Structure and encoding of the `SettlementResponse` schema
- **Examples**: Complete examples of successful and failed `SettlementResponse` data

## Error Handling

Define transport-specific error handling:

- **Error Types**: How different x402 error conditions map to transport-specific mechanisms
- **Error Format**: Structure of error responses (may include `PaymentRequirementsResponse` for payment-related errors)
- **Examples**: Error response examples showing both technical errors and payment requirement errors
