> **ðŸ“Œ** Not all of the thirdâ€‘party APIs listed below natively support x402 todayâ€”and thatâ€™s totally fine.
> Wrap any API or scraper you need behind a thin x402 server (a dozen lines of code), then let agents pay through the protocol.
> Have questions? Open a grant or reach out to @murrlincoln on X or GitHub.

## How to Contribute

1. **Pick or build your own project.** 
2. **Stand up a wrapper.** Build a small HTTP service (and/or MCP Server) that calls the required API and exposes a paid endpoint.
3. **Show, donâ€™t tell.** Record aâ€¯â‰¤â€¯2â€‘minute video of an agent or human using your service and tag @coinbaseDev on X.

Impact-based microâ€‘grants up to **\$3k** are available for projects that unlock new demand or supply and are live on mainnet.
